## About the Collection

_The below is adapted from the extensive [finding aid](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv97133/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=psychiana) to the "Frank Bruce Robinson Papers, 1929-1951," which was first prepared in 1980 by Judith Nielsen._

In August 1955, Alfred Robinson and Pearl Robinson gave the University of Idaho Library many Psychiana related items, including four large boxes which were to remain sealed for 25 years. These boxes were opened in January 1980 and the contents sorted; the material is now contained in seven file boxes. In 2014, these boxes were digitized and described by Eric Greenwell. In 2018, the metadata Greenwell produced was used to produce this digital collection. 

## Contents
Included in the three boxes of correspondence are letters between Psychiana headquarters and students in eighteen countries. Carbon copies of Psychiana's replies are attached to most of the original letters from students. The letters from students which Robinson used in his publications are marked with quotation marks; occasionally words were changed or sentences rearranged. 

The remaining boxes contain copies of all the Psychiana lessons, copies of Psychiana Weekly and other similar publications, typescripts of speeches and articles by Frank Robinson, broadsides used in advertising, newspaper clippings, magazine articles, a scrapbook of clippings kept by Robinson, and photographs.

This is a very important collection not only for those researching Dr. Frank B. Robinson and the impact of Psychiana, but also for those interested in non-orthodox religion. Anyone interested in effective advertising methods would also find this collection useful.
