# Notes

Needs about page!  Ivar and Pat will provide I assume

Pages for each camp and company with own browse? 
Dropdown menus at top providing access, and then browse buttons connecting to those? 

That'd be good. 

Adding CCC camp and CCC company information to item page and making it searchable. 

Will also need to add that to the card. 

Added "numerical-order" option to theme for easier build with next previous buttons in collections that have ordered items


Should we adjust it so you can control how many cards appear on browse too???
