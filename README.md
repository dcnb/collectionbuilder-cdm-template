# Notes

Locations metadata issues --> some are LCSH some are not. All over the place

Needs about page!  Ivar and Pat will provide I assume

Pages for each camp and company with own browse? 
Dropdown menus at top providing access, and then browse buttons connecting to those? 

That'd be good. 

Adding CCC camp and CCC company information to item page and making it searchable. 

Will also need to add that to the card. 

Added "numerical-order" option to theme for easier build with next previous buttons in collections that have ordered items


Should we adjust it so you can control how many cards appear on browse too???

The 

To do so, librarians and staff work with a clean version of a single collection's metadata, as stored in a .csv document linked via this Jekyll repository's [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template/blob/master/_config.yml) file.
Collection settings are customized using the [`_data/theme.yml`](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template/blob/master/_data/theme.yml).

Prototype examples:

- [Mark Brooks Calnon Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/calnon/index.html) 
- [Idaho Cities & Towns](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cities/)
- [CCC Idaho](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cccidaho/)
- [Idaho Waters Digital Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/iwdl/)

While this tool was built specifically for use at the University of Idaho Library, any other institution currently using CONTENTdm should also be able to use it with properly formatted metadata (use one of our CSVs as a model) and the correct url varibles in the `_config.yml` and `_data/theme.yml` files. 
We intend to further refine this and related CollectionBuilder tools over the course of the next year, adding a great deal more documentation and guides for the tool's use.
